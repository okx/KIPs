Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft OIPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your OIP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside. 

# OIP Status Terms

* Draft - an OIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* Last Call - an OIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
* Accepted - a Matching trading Engine OIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an OIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the OIP process. If such a decision is made, the OIP will move to final.
* Final (non-  Matching trading Engine ） - an OIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
* Final (Matching trading Engine） - an OIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.

# Preferred Citation Format
The canonical URL for a OIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at <https://github.com/okex/OIPs>. 
For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is <https://github.com/okex/OIPs/blob/master/OIP-1.md>.
